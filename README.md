insta-focused is a project that allows users to message on instagram, without distractions such as stories, explore, reels, etc.

## Process
* A platform is presented to users, where they can log in using their instagram account. Note: a business account is required.
* Then, insta-focused communicated with the instagram messaging APIs, and sets up an interface to send messages.
* No other distractions, such as stories, are visible to the user.
* The user can now block instagram.com, and message completley through insta-focused.

## Local Setup
```
git clone git@github.com:manav1411/insta-focused.git
cd insta-focused
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Important Notes
due to API changes by instagram, messages are now unsupported in this format. As such, I am no longer working on insta-focused.\
This application is not published on the internet.
